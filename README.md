Python serverless web framework with microservices in mind. 

## Quick History
Cappy is the foundation for the Capless CAP (Content and Application Platform). What is a CAP? We like to think of it as an evolution of the CMS or sort of a marriage of the microservices, MVC framework model, and the CMS. Capless is more of the frontend framework (ex. Wordpress) and Cappy is the backend framework (ex. Django).

## Overall Goal
Build a framework that makes it easier to deploy large or small apps in a scalable way using microservices on a Functions as a Service platform (ex. AWS Lambda). 

## Micro Goals (smaller parts of the overall goal)
- Should be easy to scale each app (aka recipes) independently
- Recipes (plugins) should be easy to install and setup
- Multi-stage deployments should be simple
- Simple to run or invoke recipes locally for developmenet or sanity checks

##Features
- Automatic Admin
- Launch button deploys
- Extensible CLI
- Easy deploy
- 100% CloudFormation Resources
- Loosely coupled plugins and apps
- Jinja2 Templates
- Simple unit testing
- Multiple web deployment strategies
- Extensible auth backends
- VPC Support
- Strong integration with Environment Variables
